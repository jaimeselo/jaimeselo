Hi! I'm Jaime Sevilla Lorenzo. I'm a journalist with more than 7 years of experience, most of it at Spanish digital media outlet elDiario.es, but I'm now learning software developping. I'm focusing on backend technologies through Python and Django, but I have also some frontend skills: I can use HTML, CSS, SASS and Bootstrap.
